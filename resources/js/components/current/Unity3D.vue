			Unity3D
		</h1>
		<p>
			I play video games. Why not code one?
			I've been conducting experiments with Unity3D to see what kind of limits Unity can take me to and to start
			building simple game components that I can later drop in on a game I'm developing and have certain
			functionality
			already working the way I want it.
			A few examples
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>FPS character</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Camera functionality</li>
				<li>Body (aka arms and hands) Models and animations</li>
				<li>Weapons with bullet physics</li>
				<li>Climbing Mechanics</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Audio Manager</li>
			<li>Scene Builder</li>
		</ul>
