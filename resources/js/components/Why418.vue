			Why do you use 418?
		</h1>
		<p>
			I have been a web developer for a few years now.
			Sometimes I'll see things that make me smile, but one thing that made me laugh when I saw it was the official
			MDN HTTP status code 418 "I'm a tea pot".
			It's an April Fool's joke from 1998 and some websites enjoy implementing it for a laugh.
